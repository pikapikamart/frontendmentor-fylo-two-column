## My process

Hello, this is my 19th solution in frontend mentor. I did this challenge as my first mobile first workflow solution. Using mobile first for me is really new but I can see why many use this. Some parts are more easy to manage and do unlike to the traditional desktop first. This is really great for me since this will be my first step to further enhance mobile first workflow.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

What I learned the most in here is the mobile first workflow, since this is my first mobile first challenge.

### Continued development

I will now continue developing more sites using mobile first workflow^^
